2.1 Divide wireless from wired network
It's possible to make the roadwarrior connect to the bridge interface as well.

2.5. Configure IPSec
I've used vlan1 instead of eth1 in the interfaces= statement.
I've had to add aes-md5,3des-md5 to the esp= statement (WinXP defaults to 3des-md5 when trying to connect)

Regarding firewalling, I'm no netfilter guru so the following config may contain redundant statements :
To ensure forwarding beetween l2tp & lan interface, /etc/firewall.user is populated with the following :
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/functions.sh

WAN=$(nvram get wan_ifname)
LAN=$(nvram get lan_ifname)

L2TP0="ppp0"

iptables -F input_rule
iptables -F output_rule
iptables -F forwarding_rule
iptables -t nat -F prerouting_rule
iptables -t nat -F postrouting_rule

iptables -A FORWARD -i $LAN -o $L2TP0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $L2TP0 -o $LAN -j ACCEPT

To ensure that ipsec will pass in on the external interface, /etc/config/firewall is populated with the following :
accept:proto=udp dest=a.b.c.d dport=500
accept:proto=udp dest=a.b.c.d dport=4500
accept:proto=esp dest=a.b.c.d

It may be possible to loosen the setup by removing dest=a.b.c.d statements.
